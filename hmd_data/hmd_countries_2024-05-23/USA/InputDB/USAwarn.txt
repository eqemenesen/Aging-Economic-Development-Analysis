The HMD mortality data for years 2010-2021 are preliminary as the US Census Bureau has yet to revise its inter-censal (2010-2019) and post-censal (2020-2021) population estimates using the results of the 2020 Population census. We will update the HMD data series as soon as the US Census Bureau has released new population estimates. See the Background and Documentation file for more details.
