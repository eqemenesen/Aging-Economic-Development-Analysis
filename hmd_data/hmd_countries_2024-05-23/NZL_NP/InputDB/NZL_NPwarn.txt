WARNING: The Background and Documentation for the Total Population contains all of the documentation for the country as a whole as well as for ethnic subgroups. Due to the rounding in the official death counts, data for the period 2014 onwards should be used with extra caution (using five-year age groups is recommended). Because of unresolved data quality problems, the series for Maori and Non-Maori are temporarily discontinued.
